The security tests for both JSP and servlet performs the same functionality.

So the common code between JSP and servlet is kept under 

    TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/jspservletsec/secbasicClient.java
    TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/jspservletsec/secformClient.java

And they are extended and used under  

    TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jsp/spec/security/secbasic/Client.java  (JSP)
    TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/servlet/spec/security/secbasic/Client.java (Servlet)

    TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jsp/spec/security/secform/Client.java   (JSP)
    TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/servlet/spec/security/secform/Client.java  (Servlet)
